# Zephy_Waf_Helper
Simple utility for creating new files for working with CryWaf

When CryWaf was introduced as the new build tool for Cryengine, I didn't care much for creating new .h/.cpp files by hand.
Right now, the tool simply takes care of the creation of those files.
In the future, perhaps templates or something of the sort.
